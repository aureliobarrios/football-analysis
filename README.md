# football-analysis
In this repository I use Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Deep Learning to create a football analysis system. This is an AI/ML football analysis system that incorporates YOLO, OpenCV and Python to build an object detector to detect players from a football match and capture some essential stats like possession and player movement.
